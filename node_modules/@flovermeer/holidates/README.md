# Holidates

## Hi and welcome on Holidates !

Search for the legal holidays of any country ! 
You only need to enter a **existing country** (*Mordor* is not legal, unfortunately, but I'm sure *Orcs* need holidays too...) and a **date** (*further* dates work, *past* either...)

## How to install

Create a directory, right click and open terminal. Execute the command :
**npx @flovermeer/holidates**

###Enjoy !
